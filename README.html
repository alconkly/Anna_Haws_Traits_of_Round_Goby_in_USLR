### INTRODUCTION
#### This repository contains the collected dataset and detailed analysis of round goby (<i> Neogobius melanostomus </i>) population data in the upper St. Lawrence River. The paper will be linked upon publication. Please feel free to email the corresponding author with questions.

#### The methods included are meant to aid researchers with repeatable dta collection and analyses of round goby life history. Many of the analyses are derived from Ogle 2016.

### CONTENTS
#### FOLDER: DATA

- META_ANALYSIS.xlsx : Compilation of life history metrics sourced from the literature. Study supporting information includes the literature source, study system, region, and site, the year that fish were collected for the study, and the year round gobies were first observed at that location. The extracted population parameters include maximum age and total length, length at age, Von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters, M:F sex ratio, age at 50% maturity, annual mortality (A), spawning duration, used collectio gears, and used aging method. An abridged version of the full data table is Table 1 in the paper.

- NOT_DISSECTED.xlsx : Basic data for all round gobies not further processed, including date and site of capture, sex, mass (g), and total length (mm).

- DISSECTED.xlsx : All data collected round gobies further processed for age and maturity analyses. Includes a unique specimen identifier, date and site of capture, sex, total length (mm), mass (g), gonad mass (g), liver mass (g), maturity status, age, otolith radius [OR] and diameter [OD] (mm), annulus increment width and cumulative otolith radius at annulus (mm).
